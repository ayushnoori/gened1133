# Computational Analysis of Civil War-Era Literature

This digital humanities research study integrated close reading with a custom computational pipeline for linguistic analysis – including natural language processing and machine learning – to uncover patterns of caricature and sentiment bias in Civil War-era literature. The proof-of-concept corpus of literature included:
* _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ (1852)
* _Aunt Phillis's Cabin_ (1852)
* _Twelve Years a Slave_ (1853)

I analyzed over 2 million characters, 488,105 tokens, and 20,646 sentences, performing AI-assisted canonical character identification and harmonization, sentiment analysis, lexical profiling, and social network construction. My computational analyses corroborated qualitative scholarship from Garrison, Yarborough, Furnas, Baldwin, and others, quantifying the presence of racial caricaturing in both _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ and _Aunt Phillis's Cabin_.
